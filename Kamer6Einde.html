        <p>
            You enter the last door. It seems you are the first to reach the end of the game. The masked man stands
            there as
            well to congratulate you. “It seems you have beaten my puzzles. In that case I welcome you to la Spade’s
            school
            for gambler’s .
            <br>
            The other participants have lost so it seems but don’t worry, it’s not something you have to
            worry about. “ Now please come this way and aloe me to introduce you to my school. A new life for you begins
            here” he says.

            The masked man escorts you to another building not too far away, this one bigger than the other. “This is
            where
            a new chapter begins for me, maybe this time I will win big.” you think to yourself.
