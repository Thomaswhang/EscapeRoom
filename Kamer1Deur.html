        <p>You, the protagonist are a long time gambler. Addicted to the thrill and excitement it gives, you
            find yourself ever longing for more. You have faced many challenges, whether they were in casino’s,
            races or even street gambles.
            <br>
            But even long time experienced gamblers make mistakes, and you are no exception.
            Not longer after you gambled everything away in a casino game you receive a letter. You decide to
            read the letter and it says the following: “Dear sir.
            <br>
            We know how much you love gambling however know as well that yesterday you lost it all at a casino.
            We from the La spades school for gamblers have decided to give you a second chance at life.
            <br>
            On 31/10/2023, at 15:30 on the Espada street 16. we will host a tryout for our school. During this
            time participants who just like you, love gambling have a chance to be a student at our school. Of
            course if you win you will as well will be well rewarded. If you lose, you will lose more than what
            you have already lost. Will you take the gamble or life a life in solitude?”.
            <br>
            Confused but without options you decide participate this “tryout” of theirs.
            A week passes and you arrive at the said destination. In front of you, you see a rather tall
            building that appears as a school. As soon as you enter you are greeted who supposedly work for the
            school.<br>

            They tell you to sign a contract firstly. You decide to sign it and after you’re done they guide you
            to the gathering room, the inside of the room is classy and chic. Something you would never be able
            to afford. Alongside the room there are 6 other participants in the room with you.
            <br>
            A dead silence befalls upon the room, before you could say anything, a masked man enters the room.
            Wearing a top hat and a black suit you soon seem to realize that this man is the same person from
            the casino you lost against. Angered you decide to calm yourself and listen to the man so not to
            make any mistakes like last time.
            <br>
            In a deep like voice the masked man says the following: “Welcome everyone, I the principal of the
            well established location welcome you to La spade’s school for gamblers. You probably wonder why
            you’re here. That’s rather easy, really. You’re here because you lost it all at gambling, so we
            decided to give you a second chance. Usually we would welcome more students to our school, however
            we decided this time we will only take 1, hence why there are only 6 of you.
            <br>
            Now allow me to explain
            what great events you all will be participating in” he says with a wide grin.
            <br>
            “All of you 6 tryouts
            will be participating in puzzles and games that you must each solve and win against each other, the
            games will all be related to gambling of course.
            <br>
            The winner will be allowed into our school as the
            losers will lose everything they own, literally of course. Unfortunately
            <br>
            Since you all signed the contract, there will be no backing out now as told in the small letters.”
            <br>
            The others disagree at first but decide to play anyways because just like you, they have nothing to
            lose.
