            You enter a big door and inside the room are 6 more doors, the masked man tells
            everyone to
            pick a door. As soon as you do the game will finally begin.
            You pick the door that’s most to the left. Once you enter you are greeted by a shining golden room and a
            locked door at the end of the room. In the middle you see a table with on top a wooden cube.
            <br>
            A screen flashes and you are told what to do. “In the middle you see a wooden cube, the goal of this
            puzzle is to take the key out of the cube by shifting the parts around to take the key out.
            <br>
            You are not
            allowed to break the puzzle by any physical means, upon doing so will result in immediate
            disqualification. You have 15 minutes, good luck”. You pick the cube up and start shifting the parts
            around.
